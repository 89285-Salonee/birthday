Happy Birthday, Baby😚
On your birthday, I just want to say a few things I won’t take much of your time, but here it goes. Thank you for giving me so much love, support, motivation, and happiness. I’m really grateful and lucky to have you in my life.

You’re really brave for handling all my different personalities without getting angry. I love you that's why I get angry all the time. I also know I’m very clingy, but I’ll work on myself and on my life so you don’t have to suffer all the time.

Personally, I feel you’re an extremely amazing person. You’re so enthusiastic about technical stuff, and I genuinely love seeing you like that it motivates me to work hard too. Recently I'm getting interest in that technical stuff also...I feel like studying now, just by watching how dedicated you are. Seeing you constantly learning new skills and trying new things inspires me a lot.

You’re also a very kind person, but know that when to act kind when not to... Sometimes nice people get taken advantage of, and I hope you always protect your heart. I hope you got that.

And don't want anything from you, I do is out of love, and I don’t expect anything in return from now. The way you always feed me the first and last bite wherever we go, and make sure I’ve eaten well, means so much to me. I’m a girl who finds happiness in little things, and those moments make me truly happy.

You make me happy and yes, very angry sometimes too but still I love you. I hope you continue loving this angry girl. Maybe I did something good in my past life to deserve you in this one.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you so much, baby. Thank you for being the most incredible man I could ever wish for. Thank you for listening to me my random rants, baseless gossip, and everything in between. Thank you for always being there for me.

Words can’t express how lucky and grateful I am to have you in my life. I’m always here for you whenever you need a shoulder to lean on.
I love you more than words can ever say.❤️❤️

Happy Birthday! 🎉
